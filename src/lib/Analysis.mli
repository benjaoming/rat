(** Analysis of ReDoS attacks. *)

(** Describes a language of dangerous words for a regular expression. The family
    of attack words is described by a prefix, a pump and a suffix. If [f] is a
    family with prefix [pre], pump [pump] and suffix [suf], then the
    corresponding attack language is [pre ⋅ pump* ⋅ suf]. *)

      most [n]. *)

  val to_lang : t -> ExtRe.t
  (** [to_lang fs] is the regular expression recognizing the language described
      by the set of attack families. *)

  val get_exploit_string : t -> (char -> bool) -> ExploitString.t option
  (** [get_exploit_string fs pred] is an exploit string from the attack family
      such that each character in the exploit string respect the predicate
      [pred]. If such string does not exist return [None]. *)

  (** [simplify fs] is a set of attack families that recognizes the same attack
      language as [fs], but should be more readable. It is very slow, because
      the corresponding minimal NFA is build first. Should be used only to print
      the result. *)

(** [analyze r] analyzes the regular expression [r] and returns the set of
    families that are dangerous for [r]. *)
